\section{Introduction}
\textbf{Define} error of a classifier (aka \textit{true error}) as probability of it making a mistake given a random data point.
\[
    L_{D,f}(h) = \underset{x \sim D}P[h(x) \neq f(x)] = D(\{x: h(x) \neq f(x)\})
\]
where D is the distribution from where a data point x is drawn, $f$ is a known \textit{correct} function which always gives the correct labels to a data point. By this definition $D(A)$ is the probability of observing a random point $x$ from $A$.

\textbf{Define} \textit{training error} or \textit{emperical risk} as 
\[
    L_S(h) = \frac{|i \in [m]: h(x_i) \neq y_i|}{m}
\]
where $S$ is the training \textit{set} (it is actually a sequence since points can repeat and classifiers often take into account their order) of the form $\{(x_i, y_i)\}$. If you naively minimize this emperical risk then you are likely to overfit. To avoid it, you use some prior knowledge about the \textit{kind of classifier} that can possibly fit to the data and restrict your hypothesis search space to those types of classifiers.


This kind of restriction induces a \textit{bias} in the model (aka \textit{inductive bias}). In this setting, define 
\[
    h_S = ERM_h(S) \in \underset{h \in \mathcal{H}}{argmin}~L_S(h).
\]
This is a tradeoff -- choosing a restricted \mathcal{H} can add too much bias but choosing a large \mathcal{H} may lead to overfitting.

\paragraph{Finite hypothesis class} If we restrict \mathcal{H} to have an upper bound on its size then $ERM_h$ will not overfit if we have \textit{large} training data (how large will depend on size of \mathcal{H}).

\paragraph{Realizability Assumption} There exists $h^* \in \mathcal{H}$ such that $L_{D,f}(h^*) = 0$ i.e. it never makes a mistake which means that $L_S(h^*) = 0$. Since this is the least possible error, this means that for every $ERM$ hypothesis $L_S(h_S) = 0$. We are however interested in true error of $h_S$ i.e. $L_{D,f}(h_S)$.

\paragraph{iid assumption} Assume that elements of $S$ are identically and independently distributed according to $D$ denoted by $S \sim D^m$.
