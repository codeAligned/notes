\section{Introduction}
\subsection{warm-up}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A game in my understanding is an \textit{interaction} between agents or players. They take some \textit{actions} to achieve some goal (usually the maximization of their expected utility). These actions can be simultaneous or sequential \textcolor{red}{or mixed?}, actions can be one step or multi step, their actions and action histories may/may not be visible to others, the players themselves may/may not be rational and/or intelligent. 
	
	In a non-cooperative game, players will not form a coalition with one another and will not play \textit{together} whereas in cooperative GT, players form coalitions and decide to play a defined strategy (to increase their utility).
	\item In game theory, we are given a game and we analyze various types of equilibria in the game whereas in mechanism design we are given a social choice function that we want to implement and we design a game that implements it in the optimal case.
	\item Intelligence assumes that players are capable of computing the \textit{optimal strategy} (for rational players this strategy is maximizing their expected utility). Rationality assumes that players will play to maximize their expected utility.
\end{enumerate}
